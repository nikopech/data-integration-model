# InterTADs

InterTADs is an open-source tool written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), 
for integrating multi-omics data (e.g. DNA methylation, expression, mutation) 
from the same physical source (e.g. patient) taking into account the chromatin
configuration of the genome, i.e. the topologically associating domains (TADs).

## Installation

You can simply clone the repository by using [git](https://git-scm.com/):

```
git clone https://github.com/BiodataAnalysisGroup/InterTADs.git
```




## Data 

The proposed method was evaluated on data from Chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
(DNA methylation and expression values). The datasets have been deposited in the
[ArrayExpress](www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) database at EMBL‐EBI under the
accession numbers E‐MTAB‐6955 and E‐MTAB‐6962, respectively.
